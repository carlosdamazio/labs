# Labs

This is a monorepo that holds my labs that I do for researching. It might be either short
research projects, snippets, or anything that glimpse my attention. It includes projects
in many programming languages, and a variety of tools that are being used. If you wish to
replicate anything from here, remember: it's not within my responsibility if you do so.
A lot of this stuff are temporary, and may be outdated as time goes by, but rest asure
that I want to keep as much as I can from those experiments.
