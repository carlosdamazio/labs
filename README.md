# Labs

This is a monorepo that holds my labs that I do for researching. It might be either short
research projects, snippets, or anything that glimpse my attention. It includes projects
in many programming languages, and a variety of tools that are being used. If you wish to
replicate anything from here, remember: it's not within my responsibility if you do so.
A lot of this stuff are temporary, and may be outdated as time goes by, but rest asure
that I want to keep as much as I can from those experiments.

## Labs' descriptions

- rust-playground: It's a dummy project that I use as a playground, trying out some snippets,
or trying out crates from Cargo.
- test-proxy-express-ts: It's a project where I implemented a dynamic reverse proxy to a S3 bucket,
where the purpose is to hide the fact that one is trying to access a bucket.
